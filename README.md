## A Comparative Complexity Analysis

**“Chess vs Go vs Magic: The Gathering — A Comparative Complexity Analysis”**  
Richard Lam — January 2026  

The paper examines the cognitive and strategic complexity of three iconic competitive games — Chess, Go, and Magic: The Gathering — with emphasis on how information structure, probabilistic reasoning, and evolving metagames shape decision making.

Motivated by the recognition of Magic: The Gathering as the world’s most complex game by the *MIT Technology Review*, this work provides a comparative framework for understanding strategic depth across perfect- and imperfect-information systems.

## Research Scope

The analysis compares the games across multiple dimensions:

- Perfect vs imperfect information  
- Deterministic vs probabilistic decision making  
- Combinatorial and emergent complexity  
- Skill requirements and cognitive demands  
- Long-term strategic planning versus adaptive systems thinking  

Special attention is given to competitive Elder Dragon Highlander (cEDH) as a modern multiplayer environment combining:

- Hidden information  
- Multi-agent adversarial interaction  
- Negotiation and threat assessment  
- Constantly evolving strategic metas

## Abstract

This white paper explores the cognitive and strategic demands of three iconic games: Chess, Go, and Magic: The Gathering. While Chess and Go are often cited as pinnacles of abstract strategy, Magic introduces an additional layer of complexity through hidden information, probabilistic outcomes, and a constantly evolving meta-game.

By comparing decision space, information structure, and skill requirements, the analysis highlights why Magic: The Gathering has been recognized as the most complex game in the world and illustrates how modern game design challenges advanced strategic cognition.

## Relation to Ongoing Work

This research serves as the conceptual foundation for an in-progress multiplayer simulation and multi-agent project focused on competitive Elder Dragon Highlander (cEDH).

Planned downstream applications include:
- Deterministic multiplayer game state modeling  
- Human-in-the-loop gameplay systems  
- Multi-agent decision making under imperfect information  
- Negotiation, trust, and reputation modeling in adversarial environments

## Status

This repository contains finalized research whitepapers.  
Future work extends this analysis into simulation, multi-agent systems, and human–AI interaction in multiplayer imperfect-information games.
